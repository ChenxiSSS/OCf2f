# Frequently Asked Quesetions
Version: 1.2

## The Whs

### What is OCf2f?
* It is a session to practice oral communication skills. It is not an English class or an English Corner. It would be best if you expressed yourself, your ideas, and your point of view.

### Why do you want to do OCf2f?
* It is a pet project of mine, starting with a couple of friends and trying to stay practiced with my oral communications. No matter good or bad, one will fall behind on oral ability in a non-English speaking environment. 

### Who is OCf2f for?
* Anyone has a wish and needs to practice speaking and, hopefully, improve their oral communication skills.

### What is the format?
* As implied in the name, it uses a f2f format. Each week, we will have a host to arrange a topic, and the rest of us just prepare something to help us express ourselves during the oral session. Unless COVID comes back, we will mainly be an in-person event.

## The Dos

### Do I need to pay for it?
* No, it is free. We will split the bill on any related costs within the corresponding group.

### Do I need to be good to participate?
* No. One needs to practice to improve. So, just come and express yourself.

### Do I need to prepare for it?
* Yes! You need inputs to generate outputs. We are a place to practice oral skills, so you have to prepare each week to your own standard.

## The Hows

### How do I participate?
* Well, here is a list of things you need to do:
  * Sign up to join the group;
  * Agree to the "agree-to-continue" terms;
  * Fill up the preferred time slots for the session;
  * show up regularly, most likely weekly, and host the OCf2f once in a while.

### How do I sign up?
* You can either sign up through Lemon SJTU or contact Chenxi via cxshan@hey.com.

### How do I enjoy the session?
* Well, you need to show up timely each week and start talking!

### How do I host an OCf2f session?
* Well, here is a list of things to do:
  * Come up with a topic for the group to prepare;
  * Confirm the time slot;
  * Make a reservation of the room;
  * Show up on time, host the session, and make sure people stay engaged and practiced.

### How do I book a room?
* Currently, we will use the study room at the libraries. You can find the how-to-book-it from this [link](http://www.lib.sjtu.edu.cn/f/content/detail.shtml?id=6159&lang=zh-cn);
* We are also open to suggestions for other places.

### How do we decide the host for each session?
* We will use a rotation table to let people take turns hosting the session. If one has a time conflict, one needs to find someone to switch the session order.

## The Cans

### Can I speak non-English languages during the session?
* Yes, but with limited times. If one finds the situation confusing, one could use a break card. However, the break cards are extremely limited.

### Can I bring a friend over?
* Yes and no. If there are open seats, you can have someone with you via the permission of the host. Otherwise, you can not bring other people in.

### Can I join at a later date?
* Yes. If you have things to figure out, you can take a break or join at a later date. But, it is recommended that you show up regularly to keep the momentum.
