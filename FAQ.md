# Frequently Asked Quesetions

## The Whs

### What is OCf2f?
It is a session to practice oral communication skills. It is not an English class or an English Corner. It would be best if you expressed yourself, your ideas, and your point of view.

### Why do you want to do OCf2f?
It is a pet project of mine, starting with a couple of friends and trying to stay practiced with my oral communications. No matter good or bad, one will fall behind on oral ability in a non-English speaking environment. 

### Who is OCf2f for?
Anyone has a wish and needs to practice speaking and, hopefully, improve their oral communication skills.

### What is the format?
As implied in the name, it uses a f2f format. Each week, we will have a host to arrange a topic, and the rest of us just prepare something to help us express ourselves during the oral session. Unless COVID comes back, we will mainly be an in-person event.

## The Dos

### Do I need to pay for it?
No, it is free. We will split the bill on any related costs within the corresponding group.

### Do I need to be good to participate?
No. One needs to practice to improve. So, just come and express yourself.

Yes! You need inputs to generate outputs. We are a place to practice oral skills, so you have to prepare each week to your own standard.
