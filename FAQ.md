## The Whs

### What is the EchoRoom?
* It is a community platform with **self-organized** sessions to practice oral communication skills. It is **NOT** an English class or an English Corner. It would be best just to express yourself, your ideas, and your point of view.

### Who is EchoRoom for?
* Anyone has a wish and needs to practice speaking and, hopefully, improve their oral communication skills.
* Anyone who finds improving oral communication **alone** quite challenging.
* And, equally, anyone wishes to join a creative community.

### What is the format?
* As implied in the name, it uses a f2f format. Each week, we will have a host to arrange a topic, and the rest of us just prepare something to help us express ourselves during the oral session. Unless COVID comes back, we will mainly be an in-person event.

## The Dos

### Do I need to pay for it?
* No, the Expression Sessions are **always** free. We will split the bill on any related costs for special occasions when applicable. And **we will address fees beforehand**.

### Do I need to be good to participate?
* No. Everyone needs to practice to improve. Don't be shy, don't hesitate, and **just come and express yourself**.

### Do I need to prepare for it?
* Yes, sort of! It depends on your personal situation. Generally, it would help if you get inputs to generate better outputs. We are a place to practice oral skills, so it is most suitable that you prepare each week based on your own standard.

## The Hows

### How does the EchoRoom start?
* It was a pet project of Chenxi's, starting with a couple of friends just chatting and trying to stay practice. Later, it turns into a dozen people joining and developing the project as we see today. The key motive of the EchoRoom lies as "No matter good or bad, one will fall behind without regular exercise, especially in a non-English speaking environment." 

### How do I participate?
* Well, here is a list of things you need to do:
  * Sign up via SJTU Lemon to join the group;
  * Follow the EchoRoom Community Guideline;
  * Show up regularly, most likely weekly;
  * Host an EchoRoom Expression Session once in a while in your own style.

### How do I sign up?
* You need to sign up through Lemon SJTU. For any additional questions, please get in touch with Chenxi via cxshan@hey.com.

### How do I enjoy the session?
* Well, here are tips for you:
  * Show up timely each week and start talking.
  * Host your best Expression Session at the best you can.
  * Stay practiced, and stay creative.

### How do I host an EchoRoom Expression Session?
* Well, here is a list of things to do:
  * Come up with a friendly/creative/expressive topic for the Community members to prepare;
  * Plan the 1-hour session beforehand;
  * Make a reservation of the room;
  * Bring your personal laptop to record the session;
  * Show up on time, host the session, and make sure people stay engaged and practiced.

### How do I book a room?
* Currently, we will use the study room at the libraries. You can find the how-to-book-it from this [link](http://www.lib.sjtu.edu.cn/f/content/detail.shtml?id=6159&lang=zh-cn);
* We are also open to suggestions for other places.

### How do we decide the host for each session?
* We will use a rotation table to let people take turns hosting the session. If one has a time conflict, one needs to find someone to switch the session order.

## The Cans

### Can I speak non-English languages during the session?
* Yes, but with limited times. If one finds the situation confusing, one could use a break card. However, the break cards are extremely limited.

### Can I bring a friend over?
* Yes and no. If there are open seats, you can have someone with you via the permission of the Session Manager. Otherwise, you can not bring other people in. At the momentum, it is not practical to bring your friend in if he/she is not on the waiting list.

### Can I join at a later date?
* Yes. If you have things to figure out, you can take a break or join at a later date. But, it is recommended that you show up regularly to keep the momentum.
