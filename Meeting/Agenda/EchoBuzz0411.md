## Roadmap Proposal:
* Host Summit? https://github.com/ChenxiSSS/theEchoRoom/issues/27
* Expression Session with personalized/characterized naming scheme?
  * Use names instead of numbers;
  * Customed by the Manager or Session members;
  * Naming scheme example: Session Cortana;
* Add other Session formats? https://github.com/ChenxiSSS/theEchoRoom/issues/19
* Dynamic Session Sturcture?
  * Allow Manager to expand the Session from a stationary 8 per session to a 8-10 person session with a variable time slot from 1-1.5 hour;
  * The Manager should decide on a individual basis;
  * Variation:
    * 8 people 1 hour session;
    * 9 people 1.25 hour session;
    * 10 people 1.5 hour session;
  * Upside:
    * Allow flexibility in Manager's operation;
    * Allow people w/ time sensitive need to join and benefit from the session;
  * Caveat:
    * The Manager will need to book a 10 people room;
    * 10 people session is not warranted ATM.
* Platform 3.0 Update: https://github.com/ChenxiSSS/theEchoRoom/blob/QQ/Plan/Roadmap3.0.md
